# <VScode> Jupter extension - No module named 'tensorflow'
I used Anaconda to create a virtual environment with module tensorflow.

I can import tensorflow in Juypter notebook which was installed in Anaconda.

But in Vscode Juypter extension, when I input "import tensorflow as tf", the ModuleNotFoundError will occur.

This problem also happened on my mac. I don't know why this happens. I hope someone can help me solve this question. Thanks!
